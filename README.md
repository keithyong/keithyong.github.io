## About
My personal website, built on React and react-router. I use webpack to place everything into a single `bundle.min.js` file, even the `scss` files.

## Setup
1. Clone from git and `cd` into it.
2. `npm install -g webpack` to install webpack globally, if there is no webpack yet.
3. `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. `npm run build` to build the `bundle.min.js` file. Run this everytime there is a change on the JSX files to build the newest versions.
5. `index.html` is now ready!
