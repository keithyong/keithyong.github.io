# keithyong.github.io
My personal website, built on React and react-router.

## Setup
1. Clone from git.
2. `npm install -g webpack` to install webpack globally, if there is no webpack yet.
3. `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. `npm run-script build` to build the `bundle.js` file. Run this everytime there is a change on the JSX files to build the newest versions.
5. `index.html` is now ready!
